1.CountPrimes.java 

1. note the character of the primes.
2. don't use the extra  function to determinate if the number is a prime.
3. use the bitmap to optimize the memory (haven't been done yet).

2.FactorialTrailingZeros.java 

1. note the condition of overflowing
2. remember the method of count the amount of  5 in the factor of a number.

3.PowerOfFour.java

1. it's about the bit manipulation.
2. observe the form by bit of the power of four which appear that character there's only one 1 in it's bits especially in its odd position. 
3.  how to let the handle the only bit 1 in the position ?
   1. use the & and the 0101 to eliminate the only bit 1 in the position.

4.PowerOfThree.java

1. the power of  3 contains only the prime factor 3.

5.PowerOfTwo.javar

1. about bit manipulation

2.  n&(n-1) can eliminate the last 1 of the bits of the given number ,and the power of 2 is only contains 1 bit 1.

6.ReverseInteger.java

1. note the overflow when the condition that make the reverse of number overflow.

7.StringToInteger.java

1. also note the overflow.
2. note the method that determinate if the number has overflowed.
3. do it again.

8.NumberOf1Bits.java

1.  use the quality in the 5th question.

## question left

1. the comment bit operation formula.
2. the bitmap which use the bit to help us save the memory.
